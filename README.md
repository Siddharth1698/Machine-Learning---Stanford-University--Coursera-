# Machine Learning - Stanford University (Coursera)

Andrew Ng:

Welcome to Machine Learning! You’re joining over 11,000 students currently active in the course. I'm excited to have you in the class and look forward to helping you learn more about machine learning.

To begin, I recommend taking a few minutes to explore the course site. A good place to start is the navigation bar on the left. Click Course Content to see what material we’ll cover each week, as well preview the assignments you’ll need to complete to pass the course. Click Discussions to see forums where you can discuss the course material with fellow students taking the class. Be sure to introduce yourself to everyone in the Meet and Greet forum!

This course should take about 11 weeks to complete.

By the time you finish this course, you’ll know how to apply the most advanced machine learning algorithms to such problems as anti-spam, image recognition, clustering, building recommender systems, and many other problems. You'll also know how to select the right algorithm for the right job, as well as become expert at ‘debugging’ and figuring out how to improve a learning algorithm's performance.

Good luck as you get started. I look forward to seeing you in class!
